# Machine Learning Course Notes

## Machine Learning Process

- **Data Pre-processing:**
  - Import data, clean data, and split into training and test sets.
  - Note: Cleaning data is crucial in real-world situations.
  
- **Modeling:**
  - Build the model, train the model, and make predictions.
  - Explore various models for hands-on experience.
  
- **Evaluation:**
  - Calculate performance metrics.
  - Verdict on model effectiveness for the intended purpose.

## Importance of Data Splitting

- **Data Splitting:**
  - Separate data into training (80%) and test sets (20%).
  - Build model on training set, apply to test set for evaluation.
  - Compare predicted values with actual values to assess model performance.

## Feature Scaling

- **Concept:**
  - Applied to columns, not across rows.
  - Two main techniques: Normalization and Standardization.

- **Normalization:**
  - Adjust values between 0 and 1.
  - Formula: `(value - min) / (max - min)`.

- **Standardization:**
  - Adjust values, keeping most between -3 and 3.
  - Formula: `(value - mean) / standard deviation`.

- **Importance:**
  - Illustrated with a simple example of salary and age columns.
  - Unnormalized features can lead to biased comparisons.
  - Scaling ensures comparability and prevents magnitude bias.

- **Practical Use:**
  - In practical tutorials, focus on standardization.
  - Understanding the importance of scaling for clustering tasks.

## Conclusion

- **Summary:**
  - Machine learning process involves data pre-processing, modeling, and evaluation.
  - Data splitting is crucial for training and testing model effectiveness.
  - Feature scaling, through normalization or standardization, ensures fair comparisons in machine learning tasks.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Engage in hands-on experience in practical tutorials.
  - Stay tuned for more insights and applications in machine learning.

Enjoy your journey in machine learning!
