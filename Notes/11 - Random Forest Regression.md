# Machine Learning Course - Random Forest Regression

## Introduction
- Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique, belonging to the family of decision tree-based models.
- It can be applied to both regression and classification problems.
- Ensemble learning involves combining multiple models to create a more robust and accurate model.

## Random Forest for Regression
- Random Forest applied to regression involves building multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions.
- Each tree is built on a random subset of the training data (bootstrap sampling).
- The predictions of individual trees are averaged to obtain the final prediction.

## Key Concepts
1. **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models to create a stronger and more accurate model than individual models.
2. **Decision Trees:** Basic building blocks of Random Forest, used to make sequential decisions.
3. **Bootstrap Sampling:** Randomly selecting subsets of the training data with replacement to train each tree.
4. **N_estimators:** Number of trees in the Random Forest.

## Implementation with scikit-learn
```python
# Importing necessary libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Importing the dataset (position_salaries.csv)

# Creating a RandomForestRegressor object
regressor = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10, random_state=0)

# Fitting the model to the whole dataset
regressor.fit(X, y)

# Predicting a new result
prediction = regressor.predict([[6.5]])

# Visualizing the results
X_grid = np.arange(min(X), max(X), 0.01)  # For higher resolution
X_grid = X_grid.reshape((len(X_grid), 1))
plt.scatter(X, y, color='red', label='Actual data points')
plt.plot(X_grid, regressor.predict(X_grid), color='blue', label='Random Forest Regression')
plt.title('Random Forest Regression')
plt.xlabel('Position Level')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Observations
- Random Forest Regression tends to give more accurate predictions compared to a single decision tree.
- The number of trees (`n_estimators`) is an important parameter to tune.
- Random Forest models are more stable and less prone to overfitting.

## Analogy: Ensemble Learning in Everyday Scenario
- Analogy of guessing the number of marbles in a jar at fairs or parties.
- Instead of relying on a single person's guess, average out multiple guesses for a more accurate estimate.

## Conclusion
- Random Forest Regression is a powerful tool for predicting numerical values.
- It overcomes limitations of single decision trees and provides improved accuracy and stability.
- Evaluation and selection of regression models will be discussed in the next section.
