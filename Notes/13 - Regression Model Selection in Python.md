## Code Templates
### Multiple Linear Regression
```python
# Importing libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')  # Change 'your_dataset' to the actual name
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Splitting the dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Model training and evaluation
# (R-squared evaluation code will be shown separately)
```

### Polynomial Regression
```python
# Importing libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')  # Change 'your_dataset' to the actual name
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Splitting the dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Model training and evaluation
# (R-squared evaluation code will be shown separately)
```

### Support Vector Regression (SVR)
```python
# Importing libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')  # Change 'your_dataset' to the actual name
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values
y = y.reshape(len(y), 1)  # Reshape for feature scaling

# Splitting the dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Feature Scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc_X = StandardScaler()
sc_y = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc_X.fit_transform(X_train)
y_train = sc_y.fit_transform(y_train)

# Model training and evaluation
# (R-squared evaluation code will be shown separately)
```

### Decision Tree Regression
```python
# Importing libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')  # Change 'your_dataset' to the actual name
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Splitting the dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Model training and evaluation
# (R-squared evaluation code will be shown separately)
```

### Random Forest Regression
```python
# Importing libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')  # Change 'your_dataset' to the actual name
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Splitting the dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Model training and evaluation
# (R-squared evaluation code will be shown separately)
```

## Model Evaluation - R-squared
- **R-squared Formula:** \( R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{Residual Sum of Squares}}{\text{Total Sum of Squares}} \)
- **Evaluation Process:**
  1. Import necessary libraries.
  2. Import the dataset.
  3. Split the dataset into training and test sets.
  4. Train the regression model.
  5. Predict test set results.
  6. Evaluate the model performance using R-squared.
  7. Repeat for each model in the toolkit.

## Conclusion
- The toolkit provides generic code templates for quick deployment.
- The choice of the best model is based on R-squared evaluation.
- Users need to change only the dataset name in the code templates for their specific use.
